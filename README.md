# Content Scraper & Rewriter

**Content Scraper & Rewriter** is a Python-based tool that automates the process of extracting content from web pages and rewriting it to generate fresh, unique text. This project is ideal for developers and content creators who need to quickly rephrase or transform online content for analysis, summarization, or redistribution.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:**  
  Easily extract text and other data from web pages using built-in scraping functionality.

- **Content Rewriting:**  
  Automatically rewrite or paraphrase scraped content to create unique versions. This can help avoid duplicate content issues or generate summaries.

- **Configurable Workflow:**  
  Customize the scraping targets and rewriting rules via configuration files, making it adaptable to various use cases.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  
  Run the tool from the command line with customizable parameters for targeted scraping and rewriting.

- **Extensible Design:**  
  Modular code structure allows you to integrate additional features or modify existing logic as needed.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**  
  Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or a later version installed on your system.

- **Required Libraries:**  
  Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`, etc.) by running:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharathkumardaroor/ideal-engine.git
   cd ideal-engine
   ```

2. **(Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```

## Usage

The tool is designed to be straightforward to use. Below is a basic example of how to run the scraper and rewriter:

```bash
python main.py --url "https://example.com/article" --output "rewritten_output.txt"
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `--url`  
  Specify the URL of the web page you want to scrape.

- `--output`  
  Define the output file where the rewritten content will be saved.

- `--config` (optional)  
  Provide a custom configuration file to override default settings for scraping and rewriting.

For more detailed usage instructions and configuration options, please refer to the in-code documentation and comments.

## Project Structure

- **main.py:**  
  Entry point for the application. Parses command-line arguments and coordinates the scraping and rewriting process.

- **scraper.py:**  
  Contains functions to download and parse web page content.

- **rewriter.py:**  
  Implements algorithms and methods to rewrite or paraphrase the scraped text.

- **config.json:**  
  Default configuration file that holds settings for scraping targets, rewriting rules, and other parameters.  
  *(This file is auto-generated on first run if it does not exist.)*

- **requirements.txt:**  
  Lists all Python package dependencies.
